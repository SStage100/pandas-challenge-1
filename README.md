Wholesale Data Analysis Script
Welcome to the Client Data Analysis Script! This script helps you analyze client data from a CSV file to gather insights such as the most popular item categories, top clients, and financial summaries. If you're new to Python, don't worryâ€”this guide will walk you through everything step by step.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
1. Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
2. Pandas Library: This script uses the pandas library. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip. Open your command prompt or terminal and run:
    1. pip install pandas
3. Getting Started
    Load the Data:
    The script starts by loading the client data from a CSV file named client_dataset.csv. Make sure this file is in the same directory as your script.
     1. import pandas as pd
     2. df = pd.read_csv('client_dataset.csv')
     3. df.head()
    Note: The head() function displays the first few rows of the dataset to give you an idea of what the data looks like.
4. Explore the Data:
   You can view the column names and basic statistics of the data to understand its structure.
    1. df["category"].value_counts()[:3]
5. Subcategory Analysis:
   For the category with the most entries (e.g., "consumables"), find the subcategory with the most entries. This narrows down the analysis to more specific items.
    1. df.loc[df['category'] == 'consumables','subcategory'].value_counts()[:1]
6. Top Clients:
   Identify the five clients with the most entries. These are your most active clients.
    1. df['client_id'].value_counts()[:5]

    # Store these client IDs in a list
    2. top5clients = list(df['client_id'].value_counts()[:5].index)

7. Client Orders:
   Calculate the total units ordered by the client with the most entries. This helps understand the order volume of your top client.
    1. df.loc[df["client_id"] == 33615]['qty'].sum()

8. Calculate Financials:
   Create new columns to calculate financial details like subtotal, shipping price, total price, line cost, and profit. These calculations give insights into the financial aspects of the orders.

   1. # Subtotal
      df['subtotal'] = df['unit_price'] * df['qty']

   2. # Shipping price
      df['order_weight'] = df['unit_weight'] * df['qty']
      def calculate_shipping_price(df):
        if df['order_weight'] > 50:
          return df['order_weight'] * 7 
        else:
          return df['order_weight'] * 10

    3. df['shipping_price'] = df.apply(calculate_shipping_price, axis=1)

    4. # Total price with sales tax
       df['total price'] = (df['subtotal'] + df['shipping_price']) * 1.0925

    5. # Cost of each line
       df['Cost of line'] = (df['unit_cost'] * df['qty']) + df['shipping_price']

    6. # Profit
       df['profit'] = df['total price'] - df['Cost of line']

9. Check Your Work:
   Verify your calculations by comparing totals for specific order IDs.
    1. print(df.loc[df['order_id'] == 2742071, "total price"].sum())
    2. print(df.loc[df['order_id'] == 2173913, "total price"].sum())
    3. print(df.loc[df['order_id'] == 6128929, "total price"].sum())

10. Top Clients' Spending:
    Calculate how much each of the top 5 clients spent. This helps in understanding the revenue contribution from your top clients.
    1. print(df.loc[df['client_id'] == 33615,'total price'].sum())
    2. print(df.loc[df['client_id'] == 66037,'total price'].sum())
    3. print(df.loc[df['client_id'] == 46820,'total price'].sum())
    4. print(df.loc[df['client_id'] == 38378,'total price'].sum())
    5. print(df.loc[df['client_id'] == 24741,'total price'].sum())

11. Summary DataFrame:
    Create a summary DataFrame for the top 5 clients, showing total units purchased, total shipping price, total revenue, and total profit.
    1. . data = []
       for client in top5clients:
        2. clientdf = df.loc[df['client_id'] == client]
        3. clientdict = {
             'client_id': client,
             'units_purchased': clientdf['qty'].sum(),
             'total_shipping_price': clientdf['shipping_price'].sum(),
             'total_revenue': clientdf['total price'].sum(),
             'total_profit': clientdf['profit'].sum()
           }
           data.append(clientdict)

        summary = pd.DataFrame(data)

12. Format and Sort Data:
    Format the financial data to show values in millions and sort by total profit. This makes the data more readable and highlights the most profitable clients.

    money_cols = ['total_shipping_price', 'total_revenue', 'total_profit']

    def to_millions(dollars):
       return dollars / 1_000_000

    summary[money_cols] = summary[money_cols].apply(to_millions)

    summary = summary.rename(columns={
       'total_shipping_price': 'total_shipping_price (millions)',
       'total_revenue': 'total_revenue (millions)',
       'total_profit': 'total_profit (millions)'
    })

    summary = summary.sort_values('total_profit (millions)', ascending=False)

13. Running the Script
    Simply run the script in your Python environment. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your script is saved, and execute:
    1. python your_script_name.py


Make sure the client_dataset.csv file is in the same directory as your script. The script will output the results directly to the console.
